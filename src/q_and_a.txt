[Q] I need to populate a column in attribute table based on the square root of entries from another column in GRASS GIS. I tried the field calculator with no success.
[A] Functionalities like sqrt() or log() are not available in base SQLite (an issue unrelated to GRASS GIS). You will have to install an SQLite extension.

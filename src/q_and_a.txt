[Q] What is the structure of a GRASS GIS Spatial Database, and what are the key components involved?
[A] The GRASS GIS Spatial Database (GRASS database) consists of directories with specific Locations (projects) where data (data layers/maps) are stored. A Location is a directory with data related to one geographic location or a project, and all data within one Location has the same coordinate reference system. A Mapset is a collection of maps within a Location, containing data related to a specific task, user, or a smaller project.

[Q] What steps are involved in downloading and placing data in the correct location in GRASS GIS?
[A] One needs to download a sample GRASS Location (e.g., for North Carolina), create a directory named "grassdata" (GRASS database) (recommended to do so in the home folder or Documents), and unzip the downloaded data into this directory. After completing these steps, a Location such as "nc_spm_08_grass7" should be present within the "grassdata" directory.

[Q] What are GRASS GIS modules, and how are they categorized based on functionality?
[A] GRASS GIS modules are tools or functions that provide different functionalities for spatial and temporal analysis. They are categorized based on their functionality into several groups, each with a specific prefix:
    r.*: Raster processing (e.g., r.mapcalc for map algebra)
    v.*: Vector processing (e.g., v.clean for topological cleaning)
    i.*: Imagery processing (e.g., i.segment for object recognition)
    db.*: Database management (e.g., db.select for selecting values from a table)
    r3.*: 3D raster processing (e.g., r3.stats for 3D raster statistics)
    t.*: Temporal data processing (e.g., t.rast.aggregate for temporal aggregation)
    g.*: General data management (e.g., g.rename for renaming maps)
    d.*: Display (e.g., d.rast for displaying raster maps)

[Q] How can you find and run a specific GRASS GIS module for analysis?
[A] To find a module for analysis in GRASS GIS GUI, you can type the term into the search box in the Modules tab of the Layer Manager or browse through the module tree in the Modules tab. Alternatively, you can browse through the main menu or use the command line interface. Once you know the name of the module, you can run it either through the GUI or command line interface. The GUI offers a user-friendly approach, while the command line allows for efficient processing, especially for repetitive tasks.

[Q] What is the importance of the computational region in GRASS GIS, and how can it be set?
[A] The computational region in GRASS GIS is crucial for controlling the extent and resolution of raster computations. It is defined by the region extent and raster resolution and applies to all raster operations. The computational region can be set using the g.region module, and it persists between GRASS sessions. It helps maintain consistency in results, avoid clipping, and allows for testing analyses on smaller extents before running on the entire study area.

[Q] How can you run GRASS GIS modules using both the GUI and the command line interface, and what are the advantages of each approach?
[A] GRASS GIS modules can be executed either through the GUI or the command line interface. The GUI offers a user-friendly approach, allowing users to navigate through data layers and modify processing options with checkboxes. It also provides a manual on how to execute a model. On the other hand, the command line interface is useful for quick and efficient processing, especially when running similar analyses with minor modifications. Both GUI and command line can be used based on personal preference.

[Q] How can Python be used for scripting within GRASS GIS, and what are some important functions provided by the GRASS GIS Python Scripting Library?
[A] Python can be used for scripting within GRASS GIS by utilizing the GRASS GIS Python Scripting Library or PyGRASS. Important functions provided by the scripting library include:
    run_command: Used with modules that output raster/vector data.
    read_command: Used when interested in text output.
    parse_command: Used with modules producing text output as key-value pairs.
    write_command: Used for modules expecting text input.
    Besides, the library offers wrapper functions for often called modules, such as raster_info, vector_info, and mapcalc for raster algebra.
If you want to hear also about PyGRASS, do not hesitate to ask directly about it.

[Q] What are the key concepts and terminology associated with space-time datasets in GRASS GIS, and how do they differ for raster, 3D raster, and vector datasets?

[Q] How to extract strds values for points in a vector in GRASS GIS?
[A] Let's say we need to extract values of the strds to check the behaviour of HANTS at given locations and compare it with the original values. We can graphically do that with g.gui.tplot, but if you need to take data outside GRASS, say, read it into R and do some other analysis (See R_Statistics wiki page) you may use v.what.strds. This module retrieves raster values from a given strds to the attribute table of a point vector map.
```
v.what.strds input=points_cla strds=cla output=points_cla_out
v.db.select map=points_cla_out file=ts_points_cla.csv
```

[Q] How to extract strds values for points in a vector in GRASS GIS in a loop?
[A] Let's say we need to extract values of the strds to check the behaviour of HANTS at given locations and compare it with the original values. We can graphically do that with g.gui.tplot, but if you need to take data outside GRASS, say, read it into R and do some other analysis (See R_Statistics wiki page) you may use v.what.strds. This module retrieves raster values from a given strds to the attribute table of a point vector map.
```
for i in `seq 1 13` ; do
    v.what.strds --overwrite input=points_cla strds=cla_hants_${i} output=points_hants_${i}_out
    v.db.select map=points_cla file=ts_points_hants_${i}.csv
done
```

[Q] How to select vector map attributes and write them into a file in GRASS GIS?
[A] v.db.select map=vector_map file=output_file.csv

[Q] I have a strds with 506 maps in GRASS GIS that correspond to 8-day composite products. I need to sequentially list all maps which "start_month" is January, February and so on... to use them as input in r.series (or t.rast.series). How can I achieve that?
[A] You can use the datetime functionality of SQLite to perform this task, this should work for January:
t.rast.list input=cla_null_mayor65 where='start_time >= datetime(start_time, "start of year") and start_time <= datetime(start_time, "start of year", "1 month")'

[Q] How can I calculate average seasonal temperature starting from a daily temperatures temporal dataset in GRASS GIS?
[A] Use t.rast.aggregate.ds, the input is the daily strds, the sampling stds should have seasonal intervals. Then use average as method. The output will have seasonal aggregated temperatures.

[Q] I need to aggregate a strds with a granularity of 1 year in GRASS GIS, but shifting the start day one month in each run, i.e.: changing the start_time to 2003-02-01, 2003-03-01, 2003-04-01 and so on... My question is: if i recursively change start_time with the 'where' parameter, will the module t.rast.aggregate "aggregate" to the next february, march, april (what i'd wish) or just till the end of 2003?
[A] If you specify a granularity of a year, then the start time to perform the aggregation will always be shifted to the 1st January of the current year and the end time the 1st January of the next year (eg. 2002-01-01 - 2003-01-01).  If you wish to aggregate a full year but shifting one month forward then simply use a granularity of 12 months.

[Q] What is a Location in the context of a GRASS GIS Spatial Database?
[A] A Location is a directory with data related to one geographic location or a project. All data within one Location has the same coordinate reference system.

[Q] What is a Mapset in the context of a GRASS GIS Spatial Database?
[A] A Mapset is a collection of maps within a Location, containing data related to a specific task, user, or a smaller project.

[Q] What is the naming convention for GRASS GIS modules related to database management?
[A] Modules related to database management in GRASS GIS follow the naming convention db.*, and an example is db.select.

[Q] How can you find and run a GRASS GIS module for your analysis?
[A] In GUI, you can find a module by typing the term into the search box in the Modules tab in the Layer Manager, or you can browse through the module tree in the Modules tab. Alternatively, you can browse through the main menu.

[Q] How can GRASS modules be executed?
[A] GRASS modules can be executed either through a GUI or command line interface. The GUI offers a user-friendly approach, while the command line interface allows users to run modules using command prompts.

[Q] What is the purpose of setting a Computational Region in GRASS GIS?
[A] Before using a module to compute a new raster map, the Computational Region must be set properly. It defines the extent and resolution for raster computations, ensuring consistency in results, avoiding clipping, and facilitating testing of analysis.

[Q] What is the computational region concept in GRASS GIS?
[A] The computational region in GRASS GIS is defined by region extent and raster resolution. It applies to all raster operations, persists between GRASS sessions, and can be different for different mapsets. It helps keep results consistent, avoids clipping, and allows for computationally demanding tasks to be performed on smaller extents for testing.

[Q] How can you set the computational region in GRASS GIS?
[A] The computational region can be set using various methods, including setting it from the GUI, drawing a rectangle, or using the command line with the g.region module.

[Q] How can you find information about a raster map using the GUI in GRASS GIS?
[A] To find information about a raster map in GUI, use the following: Raster → Reports and statistics → Basic raster metadata.

[Q] What is the purpose of the GRASS GIS Python Scripting Library function `region`?
[A] The region function is a convenient way to retrieve the current region settings (computational region) in GRASS GIS. It returns a dictionary with values converted to appropriate types (floats and ints).

[Q] What is a space-time raster dataset (strds) in GRASS GIS?
[A] A space-time raster dataset (strds) in GRASS GIS is designed to manage raster map time series. It consists of a collection of individual map layers with assigned time stamps, and modules that process strds have the naming prefix t.rast.

[Q] What is the purpose of the GRASS GIS temporal framework?
[A] The GRASS GIS temporal framework manages and analyzes spatio-temporal data. It does not work with individual map layers but with space-time datasets, providing tools for handling temporal metadata and analyzing temporal relations between time intervals.

[Q] What are database table name restrictions in GRASS GIS?
[A] No dots are allowed as SQL does not support '.' (dots) in table names.
    Supported table name characters are only: [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
    A table name must start with a character, not a number.
    Text-string matching requires the text part to be 'single quoted'. When run from the command line multiple queries should be contained in "double quotes". e.g. d.vect map where="individual='juvenile' and area='beach'"
    Attempts to use a reserved SQL word (depends on database backend) as column or table name will cause a "SQL syntax error".
    An error message such as "dbmi: Protocol error" either indicates an invalid column name or an unsupported column type (then the GRASS SQL parser needs to be extended).
    DBF column names are limited to 10 characters (DBF API definition).

[Q] What are database column types in GRASS GIS?
[A] The supported types of columns depend on the database backend. However, all backends should support VARCHAR, INT, DOUBLE PRECISION and DATE.

[Q] How to avoid Grass84 compiling against the system Python3.6?
[A] The steps :
1. Build wxPython in a temporary Python v3.11 virtual environment (using this as a go by: https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html ).
     - Note: this was made more difficult because there is a wxPython bug relating to setup on OpenSuse (see this link for details :
       https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1067,
       and specifically this comment by Frank78 :  https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1067#issuecomment-685175041)
2. Create a wheel file, from the wxPython build using pip (still in the same venv).
3. Exit that venv, and then activate my usual Python v3.11 venv, navigate to the the directory containing the new wxPython wheel and install it with pip.
4. Then, still in my usual Python v3.11 venv, change directory to a clean instance of the Grass 8.4 development snapshot I'd downloaded previously.
5. In the bash console, set the following :  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local:/usr/local/lib64
6. Run the configure command with all the required options, then when that finishes successfully ...
7a. set this : export GRASS_RANDOM_SEED=1234
7b. initiate the build with this : make prefix=/usr/local PREFIX=/usr/local -j4
8. The build finished
